Here is the first implementation of strrepl. 

You call it once to figure out the length needed and the second time to do the replacements

You can access the code with

git clone https://www.github.com/jacob-navia/strrepl


For the tests I used the bible.txt from

https://github.com/mxw/grmr/blob/master/src/finaltests/bible.txt

The compilation is:
gcc -O2 -o strrepl-c strrepl.c

For C++
g++ -O2 -o strrepl-cpp strrepl.cpp

ANd the test is:

time ./strrepl-c bible.txt lived LIVEDFOREVER out-c
time ./strrepl.cpp bible.txt lived LIVEDFOREVER out-cpp

DISCLAIMER:
This is a first version full of bugs.

The code for the cpp version was contributed by Bonita Montero
